# Arete Product Vision

> **Your AI, at its best, everywhere.**

## Core Insight

Users invest heavily in training AI to understand them — preferences, communication style, expertise, projects. That investment is currently locked to a single app. Arete makes it portable.

---

## What Arete Is

1. **A portable AI identity layer** — Your context travels with you across Claude, GPT, and any LLM
2. **Local-first, OSS client** — User owns their data, can audit the code
3. **Paid sync** — Cross-device sync, backup, conflict resolution (monetization)
4. **Context from everywhere** — Conversations + local files + browser + explicit identity docs

## What Arete Is Not

- Not an API for developers to add memory (that's Mem0)
- Not another chat interface (integrates with existing tools)
- Not cloud-first (local by default, sync is optional)

---

## Target User

Power users who:
- Obsess over system prompts and preferences
- Use Claude/GPT heavily for work
- Have Obsidian vaults, markdown files, personal knowledge bases
- Likely use Raycast
- Value privacy and data ownership
- Would pay $10-20/month for the right tool

## Competitive Positioning

| Product | What It Is | Gap Arete Fills |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Claude Memory | Built-in memory for Claude | Locked to Claude, can't use with GPT |
| ChatGPT Memory | Built-in memory for ChatGPT | Locked to ChatGPT, can't export |
| Mem0 | Infrastructure for developers | Not a user product, requires integration |
| Custom GPTs | Preconfigured personas | No memory, no cross-model |
| System prompts | Manual context injection | Tedious, no persistence |

**Arete's position:** Complete user product with identity + memory + multi-model, local-first.

## Monetization

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | Local-only, single device, all core features |
| Pro | $10-15/mo | Cross-device sync, backup, conflict resolution |
| Team | TBD | Shared identities, org-level context |

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time from install to first personalized response | < 5 minutes |
| Daily active usage | User invokes 5+ times/day |
| Paid conversion (sync) | 10% of active users |
| GitHub stars (if OSS) | 500 in first month |

## Open Questions

1. **Raycast store approval timeline?** May need to distribute outside store initially.
2. **Mem0 OSS feature parity?** Test extraction quality on non-chat content.
3. **Privacy UI?** How to show users what's stored without overwhelming them.
4. **Conflict resolution complexity?** Start with last-write-wins, monitor for issues.
